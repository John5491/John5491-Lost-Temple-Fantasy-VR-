# Lost-Temple-Fantasy-VR-


This application was developed using Unity3D. 

Since the project was conducted during MCO and students does not have access to VR gadgets, the application runs as a simulated VR Fantasy game application.

The inputs are simualted using PC's mouse and keyboard input with the use of build-in unity's package to handle the simulation.
